The Dream (project)

The dream 🍹
 

The Mission
Dreaming about going on vacation after the course? Going somewhere far, far away? What if we were thirsty from climbing the table mountain in South-Africa right now, or sunbathing a nice Hawaiian beach and in dire need of a cocktail? One thing is for sure - we'd need to calculate how many Euros that way-too-expensive drink will be 💸

Specifications
🌱 Must haves
Pick your next travel destination and check the exchange rate: local currency / Euros.
Make a small webpage where you can enter the local rate (use a form), and it'll tell you the price in Euros. A simple calculation will do, no need to get updated rates from external API's.
Use a form that submits to PHP (no JS allowed / no preventDefault)
🌼 Nice to haves
Allow the user to choose between different currencies
Provide a button to switch the from / to valuta types (So Euro -> Dollar becomes Dollar --> Euro)
Tip: Don't focus too much on frontend, keep it simple. You can always add more styling and structure in your own time!

Need some help?
1. Create the HTML you need
    - Which elements does the form need?
2. Figure out what a form submit actually means / does
3. How to get the form data after the submit?
4. Calculate the amount in the desired valuta
5. Figure out a way to provide this data in the HTML
